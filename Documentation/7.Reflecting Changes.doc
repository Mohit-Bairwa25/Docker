File Watching in Docker
Docker can have problems with file watching due to how it handles file systems, especially on non-Linux platforms. The most common solution is to use polling for file changes.

Enable Polling in Vite: Add polling to your Vite config to ensure file changes are detected:

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    watch: {
      usePolling: true,
    },
  },
});

Environment Variable: Set the environment variable CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true to force polling when watching files. You can add this directly to your docker run command:

•docker run -p 5173:5173 -v "$(pwd):/app" -v /app/node_modules -e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true react-docker
